# Custom-Shell-Interpreter

A shell interpreter with limited functionality written from scratch in C, inspired by [Stephen Brennan's tutorial](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/). Supports ```cd``` and ```exit``` in addition to the usual UNIX commands. 

Yet to implement history, piping and I/O redirection.

Usage:

    make
    ./shell
